BENEFITS OF ISTIGHFAR

►Istighfar removes anxiety and Du'as are answered.

►Istighfar opens the door of sustenance.

►Istighfar opens the door of mercy.

►Istighfar opens the door of knowledge.

►Istighfar is also gateway of productivity !

►Istighfar relieves you when you feel that sadness within you, when you are disturbed and frustrated, and also when anxiety surrounds you. Always say Astaghfirullah Astaghfirullah…

~~Don’t leave Istighfar

A man once came to 

al-Hasan al-Basri and complained to him: “The sky does not shower us with rain.” 

He replied: “Seek Allah’s forgiveness (i.e. say أستغفر ألله).”

Then another person came to him and said, “I complain of poverty.” He replied: “Seek Allah’s forgiveness.”

Then another person came to him and complained, “My wife is barren; she cannot bear children.” He replied: 

“Seek Allah’s forgiveness.”

The people who were present, said to al-Hasan: “Everytime a person came to you complaining, you instructed them to seek Allah’s forgiveness?”

Al-Hasan al-Basri said, “Have you not read the statement of Allah? ‘I said “

Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Truly He is Oft-Forgiving. He will send rain to you in abundance; increase you in wealth and children; grant you gardens and bestow on you rivers.”‘” [Nuh (71):10-12]

There are two things in the earth that give a person safety and security from the punishment of Allah.

The first has been removed, whilst the second still remains. 

As for the first, it was the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). “Allah would not punish them while you were among them.” [al-Anfal (8):33]

As for the second, it is istighfar. “Allah would not punish them as long as they sought forgiveness.” [al-Anfal (8):33] أستغفر ألله… أستغفر ألله… أستغفر ألله…

Do not ever leave istighfar!

Please share and remember that you will receive the reward for all those who make istighfar, due to your reminder.

Astaghfirullaaha wa ‘atoobu ‘ilayhi.

I seek the forgiveness of Allah and repent to Him.

(Recite one hundred times during the day)

It was reported in Saheeh Muslim that Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) said: “I seek forgiveness one hundred times in a day.” [Muslim]

Du'a for seeking forgiveness:

Dua of Prophet Adam (A.S.)

Rabbana zalamna anfusana wa in lam taghfirlana watar hamna lana koonanna minal khasireen [7:23]

”Our Lord ! we have sinned against ourselves and unless You grant us forgiveness and bestow Your mercy upon us, we shall most certainly be lost."

رَبَّنا ظَلَمنا أَنفُسَنا وَإِن لَم تَغفِر لَنا وَتَرحَمنا لَنَكونَنَّ مِنَ الخٰسِرينَ

[SURAH AL-A`RAF, VERSE 23]

Du'a of Yunus (A.S) repenting to Allah in the belly of the whale:

“

LAA ILAAHA ILLAA ANTA SUBHAANAKA INNY KUNTU MINATHAULIMEEN” [21:87]

“There is none worthy of worship except You. You are pure. Verily I am amongst the oppressors.” [Al-‘Anbya’ 87]

Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings be upon him) said about the Invocation of Yunus “None who is experiencing difficulty employs it except that Allah would relieve him of his difficulty.” [At-Tirmidhi]

Nooh (A.S) asked for the forgiveness of Allaah The Almighty, repenting by saying:

Rabbi Inneee A-o’od’u Bika An As-alaka Maa Laysa Lee Bihee I’lm Wa Illaa Taghfirlee Wa Tarh’amneee Akum Minal Khaasireen [11:47]

“My Lord, I seek refuge in You from asking that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have mercy upon me, I will be among the losers.” (Surat Hūd, 11: 47)

We must recite this dua’a to have full faith in the wisdom of Allah under all good and bad circumstances because Allah is all-knowing; and humbly seek His help to keep ourselves on the right path.

Say: Allahumma innaka ‘afuwwun, tuhibbul-‘afwa, fa’fu ‘anni.

(O Allah, You are Most Forgiving, and You love forgiveness; so forgive me).

Say: Astaghfirullah al-ladhi la ilaha illa huwal hayyul qayyum wa atubu ilayhi

It says in hadith, whoever says it seven times his sins will be forgiven even if he should have run away from the battlefield.

Say: SubhanAllah wa bihamdihi

Whoever says it hundred times, his sins will be forgiven even though they may be as much as the foam of the sea.

Say: la ilaha illallahu wahdahu la shareeka lah lahul mulku wa lahaul hamdu wa huwa a la kuli shay’in qadeer.

And say the many other forms of repentance that are prescribed by Allah.

ALLAH HAS FULL ABILITY TO GIVE YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT! AND ONLY HE (ALLAH) HAS THAT ABILITY.

The Prophet ﷺ said, “Verily your Lord is Generous and Shy. 

If His servant raises his hands to Him (in supplication).

He becomes shy to return them empty.” [Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi]

@Abdulhaq Ruiz brother
Jabir reported: The Prophet, [ﷺ] would not go to sleep until he had recited the chapters, “The revelation of the Book, in which there is no doubt, from the Lord of the worlds,” (32:1) and, “Blessed is He in whose hand is the dominion, and has power over all things,” (67:1).

Tawus said, “They both have seventy more virtues than every other chapter of the Quran.”

1. Did Abu Bakr perform Hajj? 
2. Are Abu Bakr, Umar and Usman superior to Prophet?
3. Why did they overwrite the `Sunnahs’ (practices) and ‘Hadeeths’ (quotations / sayings) of Prophet with theirs? 
4. After Umar’s death, Imam Ali AS refused to follow the un-Islamic Sunnahs’ and ‘Hadeeths’ of preceding Kafir Khalifas. Therefore, he refused to be the 3rd political Khalifa.
5. Are Abu Bakr, Umar and Usman superior in knowledge and intelligence of Imam Ali AS? None of them could solve the 100 questions of a Jew who wanted to certify the successor to Prophet.
6. None of them could divide 17 camels as per the will of the dead father. 
7. Umar could not solve the mothers of male and female children or biological mother of a single male child.
8. Like child with the foster parents, inspite of biological parents; Islam was with crooked Khalifas and Imam Ali AS has to take care of his Islam. 
9. Umar, who said Quran is sufficient, had consulted Imam Ali AS 155 times.
10. When Abu Bakr and Umar can formulate guidelines for selection of their successors, was Prophet inferior to them in appointing his successor?
11. All Imams are spiritual because they are appointed by Allah. Whereas the Khalifas were self-appointed rulers and were, therefore crooked criminals.
12. The parents and grandparents of crooks were drunkards, idol-worshippers and killers of new born girls. Whereas the parents and grandparents of Prophet and Imam Ali AS neither  drank alcohol nor worshipped Idols nor killed new born girls.
13. None of the descendents of crooked Khalifas are Syed or Saint. Because of death threats, many descendents of Ahlul-Bayt Imams became Sufis.
14. Abu Bakr and Umar are the biggest Traitors of Prophet. Umar was the first to congratulate Hazrat Ali AS after Prophet declared him to be `Maula’. For more than 2 hours, Prophet explained the meaning of `Maula’
15. Prophet had never used the adjectives `Raashidun’, `Siddeeq’, `Farooqi’ or `Gani’ for any of his companions.
16. Did Abu Bakr and Umar were in the funeral of Prophet? 
17. Did Abu Bakr and Umar were in the funeral of Prophet's daughter? 
18. Why Abu Bakr is not a Kafir?   Is it not hypocrisy that he is called the best Muslim?
• If he was one among the best Sahaba (companions), where was he for 3 years when Quraish outcaste Prophet and his guardian-uncle Hazrat Abu Talib Ibne Mutallib PBUH?
• He never performed Hajj.
• He tortured and killed many Muslims who did not pay the taxes.
• He initiated many wrong `Sunnahs’ (practices) and Hadeeths (sayings and quotations).
• Inspite of Umar’s objections, he spared the rapist Khalid. He used him for lots of quests.
• He was the partner of Umar in the conspiracy to insult and degrade / demote Ahlul-Bayt.
• Against the principles of Islam, he usurped the FADKA from BB Fatima AS.
• Against the principles of Islam, he aspired to be buried next to Prophet. Aisha would have got 1/8th of the Prophet’s house and Abu Bakr should have been dropped vertically in to the small grave.
• He never performed funeral prayers of Prophet and his only daughter.
• He instigated Umar to hurt BB Fatima AS.
• He stopped the 1st Islamic Tax called `Khums’
• He disobeyed Prophet by refusing to go on Jihad on the last Thursday of his life because Aisha told him that her husband is about to die. He was waiting to hijack the Islam.
• He refused to accept the Quranic verses about inheritance, quoted by Prophet’s daughter BB Fatima AS. 
• He refused the hadeeths of Prophet about the witness of Prophet’s maid servant and his 2 grandsons.
• The fact is that he is the first Muslim Terrorist.

19. Why Umar is not a Kafir? 
• He had insulted Prophet by saying that he has gone insane and refused to give pen and paper to him on the black Thursday.
• He never performed funeral prayers of Prophet and his only daughter.
• He continued the process of many wrong `Sunnahs’ (practices) and Hadeeths (sayings and quotations).
• On the direction of Abu Bakr, Umar and 16 others pushed the burning door on BB Fatima AS and killed her. Therefore, these 18 ( Abu Bakr, Umar and 16 others) are the killers of B Fatima AS.
• He stopped the 1st Islamic Tax called `Khums’
• He modified Salaat (Namaaz) with folded hands. After 130 years, 4 sects (Hanafi, Hambali, Maliki and Shaefi) made variations.
• He said Hajj and Umra together is `Biddah’ (innovation)
• He formalised `Triple Talaq’ in one sitting
• He formulated `Nikah Halala’
• He disobeyed Prophet by refusing to go on Jihad on the last Thursday of his life because Aisha told him that her husband is about to die. He was waiting to hijack the Islam.
• He refused to accept the Quranic verses about inheritance, quoted by Prophet’s daughter BB Fatima AS. 
• He refused the hadeeths of Prophet about the witness of Prophet’s maid servant and his 2 grandsons.
• The fact is that he is the first Muslim Terrorist.

20. Why Aisha is not a Kafir?  
21. Why Usman is not a Kafir? 
22. Why Muawiya is not a Kafir? – He formulated the 2nd FITNA by organising Muslims in to `AHLE-Sunnat-wal-Sunnat’. He killed Ammar bin Yasir.
23. Why should I be Sunni, when there was none in Prophet’s time?

Know Your Enemy Muslim Brothers & Sisters. These Liberal/Feminist are Enemy Within Our Country. You May Disagree Some Teaching Of Tariq Jemeel But Understand Its Not Attacking Tariq Jameel Rather Its On Islam, Through Maulana Tariq Jameel. Its Time To ReUnite Against Common Enemy.Feminists, liberals and other shayateen, mainly in Muslim countries, use this tactic to shout someone down and build public opinion in favour of their cause. They do it by playing victim. And in the mould of their "oppressor" they keep finding a bearded guy with a turban to fit in. They twist his words and change the context. They muddy the waters so much that reaching the actual truth becomes impossible. 

To understand the liberal secularist and feminist project in the Muslim world, one needs to revisit the British colonization of Egypt.



Everlyn Baring, better known as Lord Cromer, was the British Proconsul-General in occupied Egypt between 1877 and 1907. He wrote about his tenure in his book "Modern Egypt" (1916). Here are some conclusions from his book:



1. The West will not tolerate an Islamic government.



On page 565, he said that it would be "absurd" to assume that Europe would tolerate a "government based on purely Mohammedan principles and obsolete Oriental ideas."



2. Muslims must be forced to adopt the principles of Western civilization.



On page 538, he said that Egypt had to be "forced into imbibing the true spirit of Western civilization."



3. Westernization must be introduced under the guise of women's rights.



Lord Cromer says that the "position of women" in Muslim countries was a "fatal obstacle" in the introduction of colonial values. (page 539)



4. The West must educate a class of young secular Muslims to be the rulers.



Cromer's hope was that a Europeanized education system would cause an Egyptian to "lose his Islamism", cause him to "no longer believe that he is always in the presence of his Creator", and only hang onto "the least worthy portions of his nominal religion" for the sake of convenience. (page 230)



5. The West must reform Islam.



Cromer says that the goal should be to create "de-moslemized Moslems", where people are Muslims-by-name, but in actuality, are "agnostic". After all, Cromer says, "Islam cannot be reformed ... reformed Islam is Islam no longer." (pages 228-229)



6. The Muslim reformer would hate Muslim scholarship more than Europeans do.



The Westernized Muslim would consider the `alim to be a "social derelict", use him in matters of convenience, but otherwise disrespect him. On the other hand, a European Christian intellectual would at least look at the `alim with sympathy and respect, as a "representative of an ancient faith". (page 299-30)



7. Modernized Muslims will become Deists.



"It is conceivable that, as time goes on, the Moslems will develop a religion, possibly a pure Deism, which will not be altogether the Islamism of the past and of the present, and which will cast aside much of the teaching of Mohammed, but which will establish a moral code sufficient to hold society together by bonds other than those of unalloyed self-interest." (page 234)


-----------

We can see therefore that Islamic reform started as a colonial project. A project that has been devilishly designed by European intellectuals to undermine the clerics, introduce secular humanist institutions, and gradually and inconspicuously lead Muslims away from the central tenets of their tradition. They knew that this reformed, liberal Muslim would not be a Muslim at all, but just a Europeanized invertebrate (i.e. a spineless being) who would maneuver the religion to his needs.



This seven-step process is exactly what is happening to Muslim youth in the West. They volunteer themselves to Western academia and pop culture, and are led away from a truly Islamic worldview and epistemology. And while they fool themselves into calling themselves "Muslim reformers", or "Muslim feminists", or "moderate Muslims", or "liberal Muslims", their puppet masters know that these are all contradictions in terms.



Times change, but right remains right, and wrong remains wrong.

@D Bradley I'm Catholic. 😊 
Yes, it (Sirach 25) was removed from the protestant bible along with Baruch, Judith, 1 and 2 Maccabees, Tobit and Wisdom. 

The book of Wisdom is also on my top five favorites from the OT.
